# Chestnut Hill ‚Äî Phase 3 Infrastructure & DevOps Changelog

This document tracks every step taken to set up AWS infrastructure for Chestnut Hill using Terraform, Kubernetes (EKS), and Helm.  
The goal is to make the app production-ready, scalable, and well-monitored.

## üìÖ 2025-08-07 ‚Äî Phase 3 Kickoff

**Goal:** Set up Terraform with remote state management for AWS infrastructure.

### Actions:

1. **Decided on initial AWS + Terraform plan:**

   - Region: `us-east-1`
   - Database: PostgreSQL (RDS) for semantic search capability (`pgvector`)
   - Redis (ElastiCache) for queues & caching
   - Single AWS account with multiple K8s namespaces for environments
   - Temporary AWS ELB hostname for dev environment (Route 53/Cloudflare later)
   - Container registry: AWS ECR

2. **Installed prerequisites:**

   - Terraform CLI v1.12.2
   - AWS CLI
   - Configured AWS CLI with IAM user `terraform` (AdministratorAccess for bootstrap)

3. **Enabled account safety measures:**

   - Enabled **Billing Alerts**
   - Created **Monthly Budget** for $1
   - Created **Free Tier usage alerts**
   - Disabled root account access for daily work

4. **Created IAM user for Terraform:**

   - Programmatic access only (no console login)
   - Generated Access Key + Secret Key
   - Stored credentials locally via `aws configure`

5. **Bootstrapped Terraform remote state:**

   - Created **S3 bucket**: `chestnut-hill-tfstate-myles123` (versioned, encrypted)
   - Created **DynamoDB table**: `chestnut-hill-tf-lock` for state locking
   - Stored Terraform state for bootstrap stack locally

6. **Configured `envs/dev` Terraform stack to use remote state:**
   - `terraform init` with S3 backend + DynamoDB lock
   - Verified with `"hello"` output from Terraform

### Outcome:

- AWS + Terraform connectivity confirmed
- Remote state storage & locking in place
- Ready to begin infrastructure build (VPC, ECR, EKS)

### Analysis:

In this step, we laid the groundwork for managing AWS infrastructure with **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using Terraform. Instead of manually creating servers, networks, and databases in the AWS console, Terraform lets us declare everything in code so it‚Äôs version-controlled and repeatable.

Before doing any infrastructure, we created a brand new AWS account with the free tier enabled and immediately set up:

- **Billing alerts** so we get notified of any charges above $0.01.
- **Monthly cost budget** of $1 to catch runaway usage.
- **Free tier usage alerts** so we know if we approach AWS's free limits.
- A dedicated **IAM user for Terraform** with programmatic access only (no console login), so the root account stays locked away and secure.

We then bootstrapped a secure, shared location (S3 bucket) to store Terraform‚Äôs ‚Äúmemory‚Äù of what‚Äôs deployed ‚Äî called the **state file** ‚Äî and a DynamoDB table to lock it so two deployments can‚Äôt overwrite each other. This remote state setup is a best practice for teams and ensures our infrastructure history is safe, auditable, and portable.

After setting up the backend, we deployed a **minimal dev environment stack** in `envs/dev` containing only an output variable (`hello`). This wasn‚Äôt about creating resources yet ‚Äî it was about proving that Terraform in `envs/dev` could successfully:

1. Authenticate with AWS using our IAM user.
2. Write its state to the shared S3 bucket.
3. Lock state changes via DynamoDB during apply.

Seeing the `hello` output confirmed that our remote backend is working exactly as intended. By doing this before building anything else, we‚Äôve set up a reliable foundation that allows multiple environments (dev, prod) to share the same approach, reduces manual errors, and supports automation later via CI/CD pipelines ‚Äî while also protecting against surprise bills and accidental misuse of the root account.

## üìÖ Next Planned Step

- Create **VPC** with public/private subnets, internet/NAT gateways, and security groups.
- Create **ECR** repository for storing Docker images (Laravel & React).
- Begin **EKS cluster** deployment.
